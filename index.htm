            <!--https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/avocado-toasts-3364588-->
            <p>Look no further. This is the easiest—and the last—avocado toast recipe you’ll ever need to know. Memorize the recipe, then use it as a jumping off point for your favorite avocado toast riffs. Put an egg on it, top it with tuna salad, or crown it with fluffy alfalfa sprouts for a healthy and satisfying meal. You can mix up the toppings too—we love Japanese furikake or everything bagel seasoning.</p>

            <!--https://feastingnotfasting.com/yogurt-parfait-just-three-ingredients/-->
            <p>Ready for a recipe so easy, its barely even a recipe? Enter the yogurt parfait! I can't think of a breakfast that energizes me more than yogurt, granola, and berries. Its light enough that you don't feel weighed down and filling enough that you won't need to snack until lunch.</p>
